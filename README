BLFS2_GUI -- A Simple Linux System with GUI for x86_64

Building

1. Build Linux 5.10.56 and Install Firmware

This system is based on Linux 5.10.56. You should first download the Linux
5.10.56 package and appropriate firmware package. Next, unpack them to the
"src" directory, rename Linux source directory to "linux", rename firmware
directory to "linux_firmware". Then switch to the "src" directory and run
"./build_linux.sh" and "./install_firmware.sh".

2. Build OpenSSL

The https_get program needs OpenSSL to make SSL connection. Download the
OpenSSL 1.1.1q package and unpack it to the "src" directory. Next, rename
the OpenSSL source directory to openssl. Then switch to the "src" directory
and run "./build_openssl.sh"

3. Build SCC

SCC is a simple C subset compiler. To build it, simply switch to the "scc"
directory and enter "make".

NOTE: There may be some bugs in SCC. You can modify the SCC source if needed.

4. Switch to Root of BLFS2 Source and Enter "make"

Installing (root required)

NOTE: Installing this system will overwrite an entire disk.

To install this system to your device, you should first switch to root of 
BLFS2 source, then run "build/install.run YOUR_DEVICE [RootSize(MB)]". If
your installation succeeds, it will print a "Success" message.
