"edit" -- A Text Editor.

*Modes*

"edit" has four modes: Normal, Insert, Select and Command.
You can determine the current mode with the line at bottom.
Normal mode is the initial mode of "edit". To switch back
to normal mode from other modes, you can press the ESC key.

In any modes except the command mode, you can move the
cursor by pressing direction keys.

In normal mode and select mode, character inputs will be
interpreted as commands.

In insert mode, typing a character will insert it into the
text at the current cursor position, and pressing BACKSPACE
will delete the character before the current cursor position.

In select mode, you can select text for copy and cut 
operations.

In command mode, you can use some multi-character commands.
After you type the full command, press ENTER to issue it.
